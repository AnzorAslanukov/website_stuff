Ok, I found out that hovering over child elements does nothing to parent elements, making the purpose of this website kind of moot. I still think it can be done but this will probably require JavaScript or some back-end stuff. Being that I still don't understand this kind of stuff enough, I'll have to call this practice project quits and move on. At least I learned a thing or two.

Finally I've come up with a "purpose" for this little website project beoyond simply practice. I will make it so that when the mouse hovers over a box, an animation or change will happen, making this my first responsive website. I personally find it cool that CSS animation can be done without JavaScript.

My Github calendar profile thing needs to look like a lit-up Christmas tree so I can get a job.
